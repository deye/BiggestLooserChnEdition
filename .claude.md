# Biggest Loser CHN Edition

## Project Overview

Weight loss tracking application for multiple participants. Uses CSV data storage and Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `looser_data.csv` - Main data storage with participant weight tracking
- `Looser.ipynb` - Analysis and visualization notebook

## Data Schema

### looser_data.csv

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| participant_id | int | Unique identifier for each participant |
| name | string | Participant name |
| date | date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Measurement date |
| weight_kg | float | Weight in kilograms |
| height_cm | float | Height in centimeters (typically constant per participant) |
| weekly_weight_change_kg | float | Weight change from previous week (negative = loss) |
| total_weight_loss_kg | float | Total weight lost from starting weight (negative = loss) |
| notes | string | Optional notes about measurements or circumstances |

## Development Guidelines

### Data Entry

- Each row represents a single measurement for a participant on a specific date
- `participant_id` should be consistent for the same person across all entries
- `height_cm` typically remains constant for each participant
- `weekly_weight_change_kg` and `total_weight_loss_kg` can be calculated from weight history
- Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for the `date` column

### Analysis Patterns

- Use pandas for data manipulation
- Track progress over time with time-series plots
- Compare participants using group visualizations

### Common Calculations

```python
# Calculate weekly change (sorted by participant and date)
df = df.sort_values(['participant_id', 'date'])
df['weekly_weight_change_kg'] = df.groupby('participant_id')['weight_kg'].diff()

# Calculate total weight loss from baseline
df['total_weight_loss_kg'] = df.groupby('participant_id')['weight_kg'].transform(lambda x: x - x.iloc[0])
```

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- pandas - data manipulation
- numpy - numerical operations
- matplotlib/seaborn - visualization (as needed)
- Jupyter notebooks - interactive analysis

## Getting Started

1. Add participant data to `looser_data.csv`
2. Open `Looser.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run analysis cells to generate insights and visualizations

## Notes

- Weight loss is typically represented as negative values in change columns
- Ensure consistent units (kg and cm) across all entries
- Regular weekly measurements recommended for accurate tracking
